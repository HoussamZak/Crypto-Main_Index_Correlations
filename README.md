Crypto & Main Financial Indexes Correlation:
Exploring potential correlations between financial markets indexes and crypto prices sinces the onset of Covid.

Description:
The goal is to explore any potential correlation, positive or negative, between BTC prices and main financial markets indexes.
Given the QE, intense money printing by the Fed since the onset of the Covid crisis we will fetch data from January 1st 2020.
Quantitative Easing consists in central banks agressively buying back debt securities, the response to the economic uncertainty induced by the spread of Covid came also with cuts in federal funds rate targets plus massively expanding their repo operations to alleviate and support financial institutions. This approach was adopted by almost all central banks aroud the globe, increasing the money supply globally by 9 trillions.

Taking this into consideration, it seems reasonable to extract the data for our correlation analysis since January 2020.
